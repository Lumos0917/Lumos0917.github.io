I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.seu.edu.cn), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn). My research interest includes Computer Vision, Multimodal Large Language Model, Machine Unlearning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yang](https://yangxuntu.github.io) from [School of School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.seu.edu.cn), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn). During this period, I focused on ICL abilities in MLLM and on hallucination in MLLM.

For intern experience, I jointed Multimodal Group which is supervised by [Prof.Hu](https://xuminghu.github.io) in HKUST (Guangzhou) from Jun.-Sept. 2024 as a intern. During this period, I mainly focused on **Hallucination in MLLM** and **Machine Unlearning**. Since November of this year, I have joined the AGI Lab at Westlake University, led by [Prof. Zhang](https://icoz69.github.io). In the future, I wiil focus on **Flow Matching** and **Diffusion Model**.
